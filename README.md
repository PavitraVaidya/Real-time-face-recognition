# 👤 Real-Time Face Recognition System  

This project implements a *real-time facial recognition system* using *OpenCV* and the *LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram)* algorithm.  
It provides a complete *end-to-end pipeline* including *face registration, training, and live recognition* with integrated *user data management*.

## 🚀 Features
- 📸 *Face Registration* – Capture and register new faces.  
- 🧠 *Model Training* – Train the LBPH model with registered faces.  
- 👀 *Live Recognition* – Detect and recognize faces in real-time using a webcam.  
- 📝 *User Data Management* – Store, update, and delete user details (Name, Age, Address, Phone) in a *CSV file*.  
- 🔄 *End-to-End Pipeline* – From data collection to recognition and record management.
